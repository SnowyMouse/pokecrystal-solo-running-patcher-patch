# Pokémon Crystal - Solo Challenge Patches

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal with patches for making the solo challenge experience more consistent.

## This includes the following:

* **Anti-spinner:** Random spinners will face away from the player at all times and never initiate a battle. You can
  still challenge them by talking to them. Note that this does not affect spinners that spin in one direction, only the
  ones that change directions **randomly**.
